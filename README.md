# Anki Freeplane Importer Plugin

This is a plugin for the Anki flashcard system that allows you to convert Freeplane/Freemind .mm mindmaps into cards.

The plugin is currently a work in progress. The backend is working with unit tests, but does not yet have a user interface.

## Installation and example

This is just a proof-of-concept so far and only imports the mindmap found in the example directory. You can change this to point to a mindmap of your choice by editing the [mindmap.py](mindmap.py) file.

1. Copy this repository into the add-on directory (in Anki, click Tools > Add-ons > View files)
2. Restart Anki. You should now see 'Import mindmap' in the tools menu
