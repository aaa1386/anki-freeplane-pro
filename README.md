# Anki-Freeplane Pro

Anki-Freeplane Pro is a plugin for the **Anki flashcard system** that converts **Freeplane/Freemind (.mm) mind maps** into Anki cards.
This plugin is developed based on [lajohnston/anki-freeplane (MIT)](https://github.com/lajohnston/anki-freeplane) by **aaa1386**.


## ‚ú® Features

1. **Card Syncing**
   Automatically creates and updates cards based on Freeplane nodes.
   If a card is deleted in Freeplane, it will also be deleted in Anki.
   Excluded Paths: files or folders can be marked so that their cards will never be deleted in Anki (explained below).

2. **File & Folder Support**
   Import a single `.mm` file ‚Üí Import Cards from Freeplane
   Import all `.mm` files in a folder (recursive) ‚Üí Import Cards from Folder

3. **Ancestor Path Display**
   Shows the ancestor path of each node.
   Helps visualize the exact position in the hierarchy.

4. **Navigate to Node**
   Click a node or its ancestor path in Anki to jump directly to the corresponding node in Freeplane.

5. **Back Card Outliner (Configurable Levels)**
The back of cards can display child nodes in an outline format.

By default, outline depth is limited to 3 levels (to avoid infinite recursion).

<<<<<<< HEAD
Users can override this limit by adding an attribute back_layers to a node.

Example: back_layers = 5 ‚Üí the outline will expand up to 5 child levels.

If back_layers is missing or invalid ‚Üí default 3 levels will be used.

## üíª Installation / How to Install

There are two ways to install Anki-Freeplane Pro:

### From AnkiWeb

1. Go to [Anki-Freeplane Pro on AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1554342344?cb=1755614751979).
2. Search for Anki-Freeplane Pro.
3. Follow the instructions on AnkiWeb to install the add-on directly into Anki.

### From GitHub Release

1. Go to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aaa1386/anki-freeplane-pro).
2. Download the latest release (zip file).
3. Extract the zip file into Anki‚Äôs **add-ons folder**.
4. Restart Anki to activate the plugin.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Setup Note

After installation, make sure to import the required card model:

‚Ä¢ `note type.apkg` ‚Üí import into Anki to create the required card model.
Based on Basic (needed for plugin).
Template name must stay the same, but some properties can be customized.

> This is crucial for displaying cards correctly in Anki. Make sure this step is done before importing any mind maps.

## üÉè Card Creation & Deck Assignment

### Card Creation Rules

A node becomes a card only if it has at least one of these fields (even if empty):

‚Ä¢ `anki:deckbranch`

‚Ä¢ `anki:deck`

‚Ä¢ `anki:model`

If none of these exist ‚Üí the node is not converted into a card.
Child nodes of a card node are used as the back of the card (up to 3 levels).

**How to Add Fields:**

1. Right-click the node ‚Üí Add Attribute
2. Enter field name (`anki:deckbranch`, `anki:deck`, or `anki:model`)
3. Optionally, enter a value (deck/model name)

### Deck Assignment Logic

1. If the current node has `anki:deckbranch` or `anki:deck` with a non-empty value ‚Üí that value is used as the deck name.
2. If these fields are empty or missing ‚Üí check ancestor nodes (closest parent upward).
3. Only ancestors with non-empty `anki:deckbranch` are considered; the first match is used.
4. If no valid value is found ‚Üí default deck = FreeplaneDeck.

**Benefit:**

‚Ä¢ Define a default deck for a whole subtree (e.g., `anki:deckbranch = Mathematics` on the root).

‚Ä¢ Child cards inherit that deck unless explicitly overridden.

‚Ä¢ Helps keep cards organized and prevents scattering.

## üîß Card Syncing & Management

‚Ä¢ Cards are synced between Freeplane and Anki.

‚Ä¢ If a node is deleted in Freeplane ‚Üí its card is removed in Anki (unless excluded).

### Excluding Paths from Deletion

Using Manage Excluded Paths, you can mark files or folders so that their corresponding cards in Anki will never be deleted.

**Benefit:**

‚Ä¢ You can dedicate an `.mm` file solely as a card generator.

‚Ä¢ Cards will be created from that file.

‚Ä¢ Even if nodes/cards are removed from the `.mm` file later, the cards in Anki will remain.

## üì¶ Auxiliary Files & Tools

### Auxiliary Files Folder

‚Ä¢ `ExampleMindmap.mm` ‚Üí example mind map for testing.

### Tools Menu in Anki

‚Ä¢ Import Cards from Freeplane ‚Üí import a single `.mm` file.

‚Ä¢ Import Cards from Folder ‚Üí import all `.mm` files in a folder (recursive).

‚Ä¢ Manage Excluded Paths ‚Üí manage paths to exclude from card deletion.

üîî Important Note:
A new script to help create Anki cards has been developed, which is very useful. To use it, you need to install this script in Freeplane:
Template for Anki Cards

üíæ Save/Install the Script:
You can save it in your user scripts folder to make it permanently available. After saving, restart Freeplane.
